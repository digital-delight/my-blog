                Even if there is no sun we have rays.Even if there are no rays we have fire. Even if we don’t have fire we have electricity. And Even if we don’t have electricity we have Hope.
There is always something we have if don’t have what we want and in the middle of journey we realised that that’s what I wanted. Dreams are not always fulfilled and even tragedies are not expected but what we know is that on each step there is something which prepares us.
Don’t you think that everything in the whole universe and Earth is meant to lead us somewhere. Us means the species not specifically Us because that will be to obsessive to compare the eligibility of the whole cosmos and us. On each level there is preparation and no challenge. Each step teaches you the process to climb up a bigger step. Today wherever you are might be a place you don’t like but give it a month or a year and you ll just realise how today shaped you for the day which is coming ahead. Things done which always reflect back so imagine things done with the right intentions can create so many magical things.
